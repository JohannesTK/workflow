# Project Summary: workflow - Agent-based CLI Automation Tool

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete agent-based workflow automation tool for technical CLI users, inspired by Claude Agent SDK, CoAct research, and OSWorld benchmarks.

## What Was Built

### Core Architecture

**Agent System** (4 agents):
1. **Orchestrator** - Main coordinator for workflow lifecycle
2. **Coder** - Generates workflow code from natural language
3. **Executor** - Safely runs workflows with monitoring
4. **Reviewer** - Analyzes failures and suggests improvements

**Tool Layer**:
- BashExecutor - Safe bash command execution
- PythonExecutor - Python code execution with package management

**Storage Layer**:
- WorkflowStore - File-based workflow storage (YAML + code)
- HistoryStore - SQLite execution history with pattern detection

### CLI Commands Implemented

```bash
workflow teach <name> <description>  # Create workflow from description
workflow run <name>                  # Execute workflow
workflow list                        # List all workflows
workflow show <name>                 # View workflow details
workflow edit <name>                 # Edit in $EDITOR
workflow delete <name>               # Delete workflow
workflow history [name]              # View execution history
workflow improve <name>              # Get AI-powered improvements
workflow stats <name>                # View statistics
```

### Key Features

1. **Natural Language Workflow Creation**
   - Describe what you want in plain English
   - Agent generates appropriate code (bash or Python)
   - Shows code for review before saving

2. **Safe Execution**
   - Command blocklist (rm -rf /, sudo, etc.)
   - Execution timeouts
   - Sandboxed subprocess execution
   - Pre-execution validation

3. **Learning from Failures**
   - Automatic failure pattern detection
   - Root cause analysis
   - Specific fix suggestions
   - Proactive improvements based on history

4. **User Control**
   - Interactive confirmations
   - Code review before execution
   - Manual editing capability
   - Version control friendly (plain files)

5. **Statistics & Analytics**
   - Success rate tracking
   - Average execution time
   - Failure pattern identification
   - Historical trend analysis

### Technology Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Anthropic SDK** - Claude API integration
- **Typer** - CLI framework
- **Rich** - Terminal UI (tables, syntax highlighting, panels)
- **Pydantic** - Data validation
- **SQLite** - Execution history
- **YAML** - Workflow configuration
- **asyncio** - Async execution

## Design Decisions

### 1. Code-First Approach (from CoAct)

**Why**: More reliable than UI automation, inspectable, editable

**Implementation**:
- All workflows are executable bash/Python scripts
- Stored as plain files
- Users can read, understand, and modify
- No proprietary workflow format

### 2. Agent-Based Architecture (from Claude Agent SDK)

**Why**: Separation of concerns, specialized expertise

**Implementation**:
- Orchestrator coordinates overall flow
- Coder specializes in code generation
- Executor specializes in safe execution
- Reviewer specializes in debugging

### 3. Learning from History (from OSWorld)

**Why**: OSWorld showed agents need to learn from failures (45-61% success → target 85%+)

**Implementation**:
- SQLite database tracks all executions
- Pattern detection groups similar failures
- Reviewer suggests proactive improvements
- Stats show reliability trends

### 4. Interactive by Default

**Why**: Trust, safety, transparency

**Implementation**:
- Show generated code before saving
- Validate before execution
- Offer analysis after failures
- Allow manual editing

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Traditional Shell Scripts
- ✅ Generated from natural language
- ✅ Built-in error handling
- ✅ Learning from failures
- ✅ Automatic improvements

### vs. Low-Code Workflow Tools
- ✅ Code is readable and editable
- ✅ No vendor lock-in
- ✅ Version control friendly
- ✅ Technical user focused

### vs. OSWorld Agents (45-61% success)
- ✅ Higher reliability (targeting 85%+)
- ✅ Narrower scope (code execution, not UI automation)
- ✅ Stable APIs instead of fragile UI
- ✅ Learning from patterns

## Usage Example

```bash
# Create workflow
$ workflow teach db-backup "Backup postgres database to S3"

Orchestrator: I'll help you create the 'db-backup' workflow.

Coder: I'll create a bash script that:
       1. Uses pg_dump to export database
       2. Compresses with gzip
       3. Uploads to S3 using aws cli
       4. Removes temporary files

[Shows generated code with syntax highlighting]

Orchestrator: Save this workflow? (y/n) y
              ✓ Workflow 'db-backup' saved successfully!

# Run workflow
$ workflow run db-backup

Executing workflow...
✓ Workflow completed successfully!
Duration: 8.3s

# View history
$ workflow history db-backup

Execution History
┌────────────┬─────────┬─────────────────────┬──────────┐
│ Workflow   │ Status  │ Started At          │ Duration │
├────────────┼─────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────┤
│ db-backup  │ success │ 2024-10-01 14:30:22 │ 8.30s    │
│ db-backup  │ success │ 2024-10-01 09:15:10 │ 7.95s    │
└────────────┴─────────┴─────────────────────┴──────────┘

Statistics:
  Total executions: 2
  Successful: 2
  Success rate: 100.0%
  Avg duration: 8.13s
```

## Lessons Learned

### From Research

1. **CoAct (code-first)**: Generating code is more reliable than UI automation
2. **OSWorld (reliability)**: Need strong error handling and verification
3. **Agent SDK (architecture)**: Subagent pattern works well for separation of concerns

### From Implementation

1. **LLM code generation is impressive** - Claude generates remarkably good workflow code
2. **User control is critical** - Always show code before executing
3. **Pattern detection adds value** - Grouping similar failures helps identify systemic issues
4. **Plain files > databases** - Workflows as plain files is more user-friendly
